# stringutil

[reverse.go](reverse.go) and [reverse_test.go](reverse_test.go) were copied from:

    http://github.com/golang/example/tree/master/stringutil

[The benchmarks were coded by yours truly, also the __naive__ and __better__ versions.]

The license was copied from:

    http://github.com/golang/example

The license is Apache-2.0 and I believe this falls under "fair use".
